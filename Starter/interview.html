                <p>Interviews can be stressful, but nearly every company or job offer requires one, and being prepared for these common interview questions can be extremely helpful. Below are some common interview questions as well as tips and advice on answering them! Good luck!</p>
                <p><strong>1. Tell Me About Yourself</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure to not tell your interviewer your entire life story here. Instead, tie in a pitch as to why you would be great for the job based on your qualities, experience, etc. (consider using the present, past, future structure by talking about your current job or accomplishments, how you got there through your experiences, and why you want the role you’re applying for and why you’re a great fit).</p>
                <p><strong>2. Why Do You Want to Work At This Company?</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure to research and find qualities about the company that personally stand out to you. Focus on the future mission and goals of the company and show how you can fit in that or share about what impresses you about the company.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Why Should We Hire You?</strong></p>
                <p>Find some parts of your future job you’re looking forward to and make personal connections or explain why you’re passionate about the company.</p>
                <p><strong>4. What Can You Bring to the Company?</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure to focus on the company’s future goals or problems they would like to target and how you can contribute as a part of the team.</p>
                <p><strong>5. What Are Your Greatest Strengths?</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure to include a couple of specific qualities that relate to the job and connect these with examples and experiences.</p>
                <p><strong>6. What Is Your Greatest Weakness?</strong></p>
                <p>Don’t be afraid to use a real example! (but use your best judgment) A great answer to this question is using something that you’re working on overcoming and showing how you’re actively working to get over that weakness with an example.</p>
                <p><strong>7. Tell Me About A Conflict You've Faced At Work and How You Dealt With It?</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure to focus on how you contributed to solving the issue and the steps you took to do so.</p>
