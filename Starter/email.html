                <p>Learning how to write a good and professional email is a very important skill to master.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Include a Concise Subject in the “Subject” Line</strong></p>
                <p>The subject line will quickly tell the reader what the email you are writing is about and will make this email easy to find and remember. Make sure this line is short and concise.</p>
                <p>For example, if you need to email your boss about missing an upcoming meeting, a potential title could be “Unable to Attend [date] Meeting”</p>
                <p><strong>2. Make Sure to Include A Proper Greeting</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure to start the email by addressing the recipient (include definition) professionally. A common greeting is "Dear [insert name of recipient and include Ms./Mr./Mrs./etc. If needed]” </p>
                <p><strong>Writing the Body (Content) of the Email</strong></p>
                <p>A useful tool for writing professional emails is an in-built grammar checker such as Grammarly to make sure the email carries a professional tone</p>
                <p>Consider opening with a statement of thanks to the recipient including “Thank you for taking the time to read this email” or if someone has replied to one of your emails, you can say something like “Thank you for getting back to me” or “Thank you for your response.”</p>
                <p>You can follow this with statement by quickly stating the purpose of your email. For example, going back to the example of missing a meeting, you can write something like “I am writing this to let you know that I will not be able to attend our upcoming meeting on…”</p>
                <p>Make sure to add more information or explanation if needed. You might take this time to clear up whatever you have said in the previous statement and explain your situation or include any other points you have been meaning to make. With the situation of missing a work meeting, you might explain why exactly you are missing the meeting that day: “I unfortunately will be out traveling on that day, but I will make sure to check in and make up any work I might miss during my absence.”</p>
                <p>End with a closing sentence. You can take this time to reassure the recipient that they can come with you for any questions or follow-ups or simply restate your thanks: “If you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me” or "thank you for taking the time to read this."</p>
                <p>Finally, end with a closing remark. Include a closing remark along with your name. For example, "Best Regards, Bob Richards." </p>
