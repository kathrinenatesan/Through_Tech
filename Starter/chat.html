                <p>By now, you might have heard of the infamous internet tool: ChatGPT. Understanding the concept behind ChatGPT and AI technology in general may seem overwhelming, but this article will break down what exactly these tools are as well as providing advice on how to take advantage of these tools in your workplace or even your day-to-day life.</p>
                <p>ChatGPT in particular is a type of generative AI technology that can engage in instant, humanlike conversation in response to a user’s prompts.</p>
                <p>ChatGPT can prove to be helpful in a multitude of ways such as making travel itineraries, translating text, writing code, suggesting emails, researching topics, generating explanations, and more. It is ultimately up to the user to decide how to use this efficient tool.</p>
                <p>Although this tool can be beneficial, there are some concerns to keep in mind when using generative AI.</p>
                <p><strong><u>1. Plagarism and Harmful Use </u></strong></p>
                <p>Users must be cautious of taking credit for any work generated by ChatGPT, especially students</p>
                <p><strong><u>2. Incorrect Answers </u></strong></p>
                <p>Always make sure to take ChatGPT’s responses with a grain of salt since it can occasionally produce incorrect or biased information.</p>
                <p><strong><u>3. Privacy </u></strong></p>
                <p>Users should always be mindful of the information included in their prompts since ChatGPT heavily relies on their input. Avoid including sensitive details and identifiable information.</p>
                <p><strong>Now that you’re educated about this technology, the next section will guide you through the steps to start using ChatGPT.</strong></p>
                <p>1. Go to chat.openai.com in an internet browser</p>
                <p>2. Click the “Sign Up” button and login with your email credentials </p>
                <p>3. After you have signed up, you can type a prompt and wait for your response. There are controls available to give feedback on your responses, view and delete previous conversations, and start a new conversation.</p>
                <p><strong>Additionally, here are some ways ChatGPT could potentially be helpful in a workplace</strong></p>
                <p><strong><u>1. Summarizing Long Notes and Long Reports</u></strong></p>
                <p>For long notes or reports that might be time-consuming to read, ChatGPT can help you summarize them in a simple fashion. Make sure to be detailed and provide context on things like what the text is about, what you need from it, if there’s anything important to look for, etc.</p>
                <p><strong><u>2. Brainstorming Ideas</u></strong></p>
                <p>It can often be difficult to think of unique concepts such as business ideas, names for products, writing topics, and more. However, with a clear prompt, ChatGPT can quickly help you generate many ideas for whatever you might need.</p>
                <p><strong><u>3. Explaining Complex Concepts</u></strong></p>
                <p>If you seem to be stuck learning or studying a confusing topic, consider turning to ChatGPT for easy-to-understand explanations. In your prompt, describe the topic you’re confused about, what confuses you, and maybe even ask ChatGPT to “explain it like I’m a middle schooler” (or however simple you want the explanation to be) and ask follow up questions if needed.</p>
                <p><strong><u>4. Writing Assistance</u></strong></p>
                <p>Although it is important to keep in mind concerns of plagiarism, if used correctly, ChatGPT can prove to be an excellent tool for writing assistance such as writing emails, basic beginnings to articles, suggesting writing improvements, and more.</p>
                <p><strong><u>5. Planning Schedules</u></strong></p>
                <p>With busy work days, oftentimes, things can get chaotic. But with the help of ChatGPT, when given details about your day or needs for a certain amount of time, ChatGPT will be able to help you stay organized by generating balanced schedules and routines</p>
